# Using macOS stickies to display a workshop link on the screen

When giving a workshop it's often useful to have a URL to the workshop materials visible on screen at all times. I use a bit.ly link for these.

macOS stickies work great for this: create a sticky with the URL, locate it in a bottom corner of the screen and then turn on the "Float on Top" and "Translucent" options in the Window menu.
